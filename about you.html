I know a place
It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face
We get married in our heads
Something to do while we try to recall how we met
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten about you?
You and I (don't let go), we're alive (don't let go)
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes
Wait (don't let go) and pretend (don't let go)
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end (in the end)

Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten about you?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten?
Do you think I have forgotten about you?

And there was something 'bout you that now I can't remember
It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender
And I miss you on a train, I miss you in the morning
I never know what to think about

I think about you (so don't let go)
About you (so don't let go)
Do you think I have forgotten about you? (Don't let go)
About you
About you
Do you think I have forgotten about you? (Don't let go)
